  <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: <strong>DATE_PLACEHOLDER</strong></p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>SimpleATC offers both free and paid subscription tiers that grant varying levels of access to AI-generated training scenarios. Because our products are digital and delivered instantly, all sales are generally <strong>final</strong>.</p>

  <h2>2. Free Trial &amp; Demo</h2>
  <p>We provide a free tier with access to static scenarios so you can evaluate the core functionality before purchasing a subscription.</p>

  <h2>3. Subscription Plans</h2>
  <p>• <strong>Donation Tier:</strong> Grants a limited number of AI scenarios per day.<br />• <strong>Monthly Tier:</strong> Grants unlimited AI scenarios during the paid period.</p>

  <h2>4. Eligibility for Refunds</h2>
  <p>Refunds will <em>only</em> be considered in the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You were charged more than once for the same subscription period (duplicate purchase).</li>
    <li>A technical issue, attributable to SimpleATC, prevented you from accessing the Service for more than 72 consecutive hours <em>and</em> you contacted our support team within that period.</li>
    <li>Your purchase was fraudulent (subject to investigation).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. How to Request a Refund</h2>
  <p>To request a refund, email <a href="mailto:billing@simpleatc.com">billing@simpleatc.com</a> within 14 days of your purchase. Include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The email address associated with your SimpleATC account</li>
    <li>Purchase date and transaction ID</li>
    <li>A detailed explanation of the issue</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We aim to respond within five (5) business days.</p>

  <h2>6. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>

    <li>General dissatisfaction after significant usage of AI scenarios.</li>
    <li>Issues caused by unsupported browsers or devices.</li>
    <li>Failure to cancel your subscription before the next billing cycle.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Cancellations</h2>
  <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time from your account dashboard. Cancellation stops future billing but does not retroactively refund past charges.</p>

  <h2>8. Chargebacks</h2>
  <p>Initiating a chargeback without first contacting us may result in immediate termination of your account and forfeiture of any remaining subscription time.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
